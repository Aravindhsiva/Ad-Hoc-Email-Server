      <p>AHEM server is an ad-hoc mail server. By ad-hoc we mean that a mail box will be created for you as soon as an email for your account reaches the server.
        What is you account? Any account name you choose.</p>
      <p>The server serves the domains:
        <md-list >
          <md-list-item *ngFor="let domain of properties.allowedDomains"> {{domain}} </md-list-item>
        </md-list>
      <p>It will check every {{properties.emailDeleteInterval}} seconds if an email has passed {{properties.emailDeleteAge}} seconds of age, and if it did, it will erase it.</p>
      <p>So go ahead, and give it a try. Send an email to whatever@one-of-the domains above, and enter your account.</p>
