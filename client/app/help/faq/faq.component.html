  <h2>What is the AHEM Ad Hoc Email service exactly?</h2>
  <p>
    AHEM is a free ad-hoc disposable temporary Email service.

    Ad-hoc - a mail that a mailbox is created for you as soon as you need it.
    Disposable - you can throw it right away. Not strings attached.
    Temporary - the emails recieved will be deleted by the system after a predefined time period.
    Free - you know what that means!
  </p>

  <h2>Can I only user @ahem.email addresses with the service?</h2>
  <p>
  The AHEM server currently serves the domains:
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let domain of properties.allowedDomains">{{domain}}</li>
  </ul>
  ahem.email
  mail.ahem.email
  ahem-email.com

  Sending an email to any of the above domains will be accepted by the AHEM mail service.
