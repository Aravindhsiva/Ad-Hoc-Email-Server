  <h2>What is AHEM?</h2>
  <p>
    <div class="ahem-definition-of">
  <p>According to <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ahem" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster</a>, the
    definition of AHEM is:</p>
  <mat-card>
    <mat-card-title>ahem</mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <span>interjection \ a throat-clearing sound; often read as ə-ˈhem ; \</span>
      <p>—used especially to attract attention or to express disapproval or embarrassment</p>
    </mat-card-content>
  </mat-card>
  <p>
    As defined above, AHEM comes and goes like a throat clearing sound. It wants you attention, but it disapproved or
    embarassed on your behalf.

  <h2>Come on! Seriously, what is AHEM Ad Hoc Disposable Temporary Email?!</h2>
  <p>
    AHEM is a free ad-hoc disposable temporary Email service.
  <br>
    <b>Ad-hoc</b> - a mail that a mailbox is created for you as soon as you need it.<br>
    <b>Disposable</b> - you can throw it right away. Not strings attached.<br>
    <b>Temporary</b> - the emails received will be deleted by the system after a certain time elapses.<br>
    <b>Free</b> - you know what that means!<br>
    <br>
    Others call it tempmail, 10minutemail, throwaway email, fake-mail or trash-mail.<br>
    <br>
    When using forums, connecting to public Wi-Fi, many times users are asked to register before they can use the
    service.<br>
    Many websites and blogs ask users to register before they can view content, contribute or download.<br>
    Well, sometimes we don't have a choice, and sometimes we are interested in exposing our identity to a service
    provider.<br>
    <br>
    But when we do not - or don't even care - storing your email address in any additional data base increases the risk
    for it to be leaked.
    AHEM is a service that allows you to register easily without exposing your real email address, so that you can avoid
    spam and stay safe.

  <h2>Can I only use @ahem.email addresses with the service?</h2>
  <p>
    The AHEM server currently serves the domains:
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let domain of properties.allowedDomains">{{domain}}</li>
  </ul>

  Sending an email to any of the above domains will be accepted by the AHEM mail service.

  <h2>How long does an email remain on the AHEM mail server?</h2>
  <p>
    An email remains on the AHEM server at least {{ min(properties.emailDeleteInterval, properties.emailDeleteAge) |
    amDuration: 'seconds' }}, and up to {{properties.emailDeleteAge + properties.emailDeleteInterval | amDuration:
    'seconds' }}.
  </p>
  <mat-divider></mat-divider>
  <h2>Can I delete my emails immediately?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes.
  </p>
  <mat-divider></mat-divider>
  <h2>What personal information do you save and how do you use it?</h2>
  <p>
    We do not keep any direct personal information. However, the emails are publicly available, so be mindful of how you use
    the service.
    <br>
    We do track accessing IP addresses in order to ensure the service's availability.
    <br>
    We recommend that you read the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.
