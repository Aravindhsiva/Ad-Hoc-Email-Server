  <h2>What is AHEM Ad Hoc Disposable Temporary Email?</h2>
  <p>
    AHEM is a free ad-hoc disposable temporary Email service.

    Ad-hoc - a mail that a mailbox is created for you as soon as you need it.
    Disposable - you can throw it right away. Not strings attached.
    Temporary - the emails received will be deleted by the system after a certain time elapses.
    Free - you know what that means!
    <br>
    Others call it tempmail, 10minutemail, throwaway email, fake-mail or trash-mail.
    <br>
    When using forums, connecting to public Wi-Fi, many times users are asked to register before they can use the service.<br>
    Manny websites and blogs ask users to register before they can view content, contribute or download.<br>
    Well, sometimes we don't have a choice, and sometimes we are interested in exposing our identity to a service provider.
    <br>
    But when we do not - or don't even care - storing your email address in any additional data base increases the risk for it to be leaked.
    AHEM is a service that allows you to register easily without exposing your real email address, so that you can avoid spam and stay safe.
  </p>

  <h2>Can I only use @ahem.email addresses with the service?</h2>
  <p>
  The AHEM server currently serves the domains:
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let domain of properties.allowedDomains">{{domain}}</li>
  </ul>

  Sending an email to any of the above domains will be accepted by the AHEM mail service.

  <h2>How long does an email remain on the AHEM mail server?</h2>
  <p>
    An email remains on the AHEM server at least {{ min(properties.emailDeleteInterval, properties.emailDeleteAge) | amDuration: 'seconds' }}, and up to {{properties.emailDeleteAge + properties.emailDeleteInterval | amDuration: 'seconds' }}.
  </p>

  <h2>Can I delete my emails immediately?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes.
  </p>

  <h2>What personal information do you save and how do you use it?</h2>
  <p>
    We do not keep any personal information. However, the emails are publically available, so be mindful of how you use the service.

    We recommend that you read the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a>.
