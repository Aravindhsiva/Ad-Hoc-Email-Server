    <h2>About AHEM</h2>
    AHEM is a next generation free temporary and disposable email service.<br>
    AHEM focuses on a modern UI, high fidelity, mobile friendliess, an easy to use <a href="/help/api">API</a> and <a heref="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server>">freely available code</a>.<br>
    AHEM was born of out of necessity, and was built as a weekend project by Oren Geva, with the help and feedback of colleagues and friends.<br>
    It is not a business, and has no profit goals. If ads are included in the service it is to help maintaining this service free.<br>
    <br>
    AHEM was built as a MEAN stack, using <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a>, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> and <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a> on top of some awesome opensource packages. Check out the github repo for a complete list and licenses.<br>
    I would, however, like to mention one of those projects - <a href="https://nodemailer.com/about/">Nodemailer</a> by Andris Reinman. THis project serves as the core of the mail server part of AHEM, and therefore is very central to this service.
