  <md-card-content>
    <p>AHEM server is an ad-hoc mail server. By ad-hoc we mean that a mail box will be created for you as soon as an
      email for your account reaches the server.
      What is you account? Any account name you choose.</p>
    <p>The server serves the domains:
      <md-list>
        <div *ngFor="let domain of properties.allowedDomains"> {{domain}}</div>
      </md-list>
    <p>It will check every {{properties.emailDeleteInterval}} seconds if an email has passed
      {{properties.emailDeleteAge}} seconds of age, and if it did, it will erase it.</p>
    <p>So go ahead, and give it a try. Send an email to whatever@one-of-the domains above, and enter your account.</p>
