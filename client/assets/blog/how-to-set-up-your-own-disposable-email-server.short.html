  Disposable email services are online services that provide temporary email addresses for registering or signing up on websites that require email verification.

  The purpose of these services is that you can avoid exposing your own email address to potential SPAM, especially if you just need the service for a short period of time.

  Disposable email services are also useful in software development and testing, as many software products require email verification themselves. Using real email addresses in the context of software development or testing is cumbersome and annoying. Many teams around the world use temporary disposable email services for testing their own software products.

  AHEM - Ad Hoc Email is one of these services. You can send an email to an @ahem.email address and check the AHEM mailbox to retrieve and read the email.

  Many similar services such as Mailinator, ThrowAwayMail, Temp-Mail and Yopmail are available online to name a few.

  Each has their own interpretation of the theme, but one of the things that makes AHEM unique is that AHEMâ€™s code is freely available on GitHub as open source, allowing a user to download and set up their own temporary mail server.

  But why would someone want to set up their own disposable mail server? In the context of software testing, while most of the time an online disposable email service is sufficient, on some occasions you might want to host a temporary email server on site:
